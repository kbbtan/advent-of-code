## Star 1

We can store the page ordering rules in the form of a graph, allowing us to iterate through all pairs of pages and detect those which are out of order.

## Star 2

This problem boils down to implementing a sorting algorithm based on the page ordering rules. My solution for Star 1 made it convinient to implement a naive bubble sort solution by changing a few lines of code, but any sorting algorithm would work.
